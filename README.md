Project Description

This project is an Automated End-to-End Test Suite built using Playwright to perform comprehensive interactions on demo e-commerce websites and various web UI components. It is designed to demonstrate real-world automation scenarios that cover a wide range of web application testing techniques using Playwrightâ€™s powerful features.

The main focus of the test suite is to automate a complete e-commerce workflow on a demo web shop. It includes logging in as a user, browsing product categories, adding multiple items to the cart, filling in billing and shipping details, selecting shipping and payment methods, and placing the order. At every significant step, the script captures screenshots to document the process and provide visual evidence of the automation steps.

In addition to the order placement flow, the project covers several key web automation tasks, such as:

Extracting and printing all hyperlinks from a web page to analyze the structure and verify the presence of correct links.

Handling web tables by counting rows and columns and extracting data to validate content.

Working with shadow DOM elements and handling complex alerts and pop-up dialogs to ensure seamless automation of challenging UI elements.

Managing frames (iframes) by interacting with elements inside them, showcasing how to handle nested content.

Performing advanced mouse actions such as hover, drag & drop, resizing elements, and moving sliders for better interaction with dynamic content.

Executing JavaScript within the page context to manipulate elements for verification purposes.

Automating file uploads (single and multiple) to test file handling functionality of web applications.

Downloading files and saving them to a local directory, demonstrating file download automation.

Capturing element-specific and full-page screenshots to assist in visual validation and regression testing.

Handling right-click context menu actions and managing browser tabs and pop-ups for more complex navigation flows.

Automating Basic Authentication scenarios to test applications with secured endpoints.

Automated Playwright test suite for demo e-commerce and web interactions. Covers login, product order flow, web tables, shadow DOM, alerts, frames, sliders, drag &amp; drop, file upload/download, screenshots, pop-ups, right-click, Basic Auth, and more for end-to-end web automation practice.
